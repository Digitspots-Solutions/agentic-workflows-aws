2. PROJECT OVERVIEW:

2.1 Executive Summary

Objective:
To design, develop, and deploy a production-grade Agentic AI Student Assistant for LAUTECH on AWS. The system will leverage Amazon Bedrock and AgentCore to automate student inquiries regarding courses, fees, calendars, and hostel accommodation, thereby reducing administrative overhead and improving student satisfaction.

Key Outcomes:
- 24/7 Availability for student support services.
- <3 Second Response Time for 90% of routine inquiries.
- 70% Reduction in manual email/ticket volume for Student Affairs.
- Secure Integration with existing University PostgreSQL databases.
- Full "Responsible AI" compliance including PII protection and topic filtering.

4. SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE

[Reference: LAUTECH_Architecture_Guide.pdf for detailed diagrams]

High-Level Architecture Description:
The solution utilizes a Serverless-First approach. Amazon Bedrock AgentCore serves as the central brain, orchestrating calls to AWS Lambda functions which query an Amazon RDS database. The frontend is hosted on AWS ECS Fargate, protected by an Application Load Balancer and WAF.

AWS Cost Breakdown Estimate (Monthly):
- Amazon Bedrock (Inference): ~$15.00
- Amazon RDS (db.t3.micro): ~$14.00
- AWS ECS (Fargate Spot): ~$12.00
- Load Balancer & Network: ~$18.00
- Total Est. MRR: ~$59.00 USD
- Total Est. ARR: ~$708.00 USD

7. CUSTOMER SIGN-OFF TEMPLATE

Upon completion of each project phase, DIGITSSPOTS SOLUTIONS will submit the associated tangible deliverables to LAUTECH, accompanied by an Acceptance Form. Upon receipt, LAUTECH will review, evaluate, and/or test the deliverables within eight (8) business days (the “Acceptance Period”) to determine whether the deliverables meet the defined acceptance criteria in all material respects.

If the deliverable satisfies the acceptance criteria in all material respects, LAUTECH will furnish a written acceptance confirmation to DIGITSSPOTS SOLUTIONS via the Acceptance Form before the end of the Acceptance Period.

If a deliverable does not meet the acceptance criteria due to any non-conformity or defect, LAUTECH will provide a detailed explanation of the reasons for the rejection on the Acceptance Form and return it, along with the rejected deliverables, to DIGITSSPOTS SOLUTIONS (a “Rejection Notice”) within the Acceptance Period.

Upon receiving a Rejection Notice, DIGITSSPOTS SOLUTIONS will promptly correct any identified defects or non-conformities to ensure that the deliverables meet the SOW requirements and their respective acceptance criteria. The corrected deliverables will then be resubmitted to LAUTECH, accompanied by the Acceptance Form. The review process will be repeated for the resubmitted deliverables.

Digitspots AI Competency Submission

Owner: Digitspots Cloud Operations Team
Applies To: LAUTECH AWS Account (ACCT-002)

REQUIREMENT:
Define standard approach to access customer-owned AWS accounts, including IAM best practices (Console/CLI access, Temporary credentials, Least Privilege).

Executive Summary
Digitspots adheres to a strict Identity and Access Management (IAM) SOP that enforces Least Privilege and the use of temporary credentials. We never use long-term access keys for human interaction and enforce federated access where possible.

1. Access Management SOP
**Policy**: Identity must be managed centrally and credentials must be temporary.

*   **1.1 Human Access (Console/CLI)**:
    *   Primary access is via **AWS Identity Center (SSO)** mapped to corporate directory.
    *   CLI access requires `aws sso login` to generate short-term tokens.
    *   Long-term IAM User Access Keys are **strictly prohibited** for human operators.
*   **1.2 Partner Access**:
    *   Digitspots consultants access customer environments via a dedicated `PartnerFederationRole` or specific IAM Users with MFA enforced and `digitspots` prefix for auditability.

2. Workload Identity & Least Privilege
**Policy**: Compute resources must operate with the minimum permissions required.

*   **2.1 Roles for Compute**:
    *   EC2, Lambda, and ECS tasks must assume specific IAM Roles (e.g., `ecsTaskExecutionRole`).
    *   Applications must leverage the AWS SDK default credential provider chain (never hardcoded keys).
*   **2.2 Least Privilege**:
    *   Wildcards (`*`) in IAM Policy `Action` or `Resource` blocks are prohibited unless strictly necessary (e.g., `s3:ListAllMyBuckets`).

3. Evidence Artifacts
*   IAM Role Implementation: `setup/deploy_ecs.py` (Function `get_execution_role_arn`).
*   Secret Access: `setup/setup_rds.py` (Secrets Manager integration).

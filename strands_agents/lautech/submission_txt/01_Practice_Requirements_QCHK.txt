AWS AI Competency - Agentic AI Consulting Services
Section 1: Agentic AI Practice Requirements (QCHK)

This document details the compliance of Digitsspots Solutions (LAUTECH Implementation) with the Agentic AI Consulting Services Practice Requirements.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QCHK-001: Model Expertise (Inference)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirement: Demonstrate expertise in using models from Amazon Bedrock, Bedrock Marketplace, or Amazon SageMaker AI/JumpStart.

Response: YES

Evidence:
The LAUTECH multi-agent system leverages Amazon Bedrock for all foundation model inference. Specifically, it utilizes the Anthropic Claude 3.5 Haiku model (us.anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0), accessed via the Bedrock Runtime API through the Strands Agents SDK.

Selection Rationale:
Claude 3.5 Haiku was selected for its optimal balance of latency (<2 seconds for typical queries) and cost-effectiveness for high-volume student interactions, while maintaining sufficient reasoning capability for tool selection and response synthesis.

Code Reference (lautech_agentcore.py):
bedrock_model = BedrockModel(
    model_id="us.anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0",
    temperature=0.7,
    guardrail_config={...}
)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QCHK-002: Framework Expertise (SDKs/Tooling)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirement: Demonstrate expertise in using AWS-compatible agent development frameworks.

Response: YES

Evidence:
We utilize the Strands Agents SDK, an AWS-native framework designed for building agentic applications. Our implementation leverages key Strands features including:
1. Tool Decorators (@tool): For wrapping Python functions as agent-callable tools.
2. Agent Orchestration: Managing the interaction between the LLM and the tools.
3. System Prompts: Defining agent behavior and constraints.
4. Session Management: Integrating with AgentCore Memory for persistent state.

Framework implementation allows for modular extension of agent capabilities without core architectural changes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QCHK-003: Interoperability
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirement: Demonstrate expertise in implementing interoperability solutions for agent applications.

Response: YES

Evidence:
The solution implements a multi-agent orchestrator pattern. An orchestrator agent interprets user intent and routes requests to four specialist tool agents:
1. Course Information Agent
2. Financial Services Agent
3. Academic Calendar Agent
4. Hostel Allocation Agent

Interoperability is achieved through:
- Structured JSON schemas for tool inputs and outputs.
- Shared session context maintained via AgentCore Memory.
- Integration with external interfaces including a Web Dashboard (Streamlit) and WhatsApp Business API.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QCHK-004: Security Controls
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirement: Demonstrate expertise in implementing comprehensive agent security controls.

Response: YES

Evidence:
The solution implements a defense-in-depth security strategy using AWS managed services:

1. Identity & Access Management (IAM):
   - Granular IAM roles for AgentCore execution and ECS tasks.
   - Least-privilege policies restricted to specific resources.

2. Secrets Management:
   - AWS Secrets Manager stores database credentials and API keys.
   - No hardcoded secrets in codebase or environment variables.

3. Network Security:
   - VPC Security Groups restrict ingress/egress for ECS and RDS.
   - Database resides in a private subnet (or restricted public access with IP allowlisting).
   - Encryption in transit (TLS/SSL) for all database connections.

4. Observability:
   - Comprehensive CloudWatch Logs for agent traces and system events.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QCHK-005: Responsible AI
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirement: Demonstrate expertise in implementing comprehensive responsible AI controls.

Response: YES

Evidence:
We have implemented Amazon Bedrock Guardrails to enforce responsible AI practices. The guardrail configuration ensures safety and alignment with university policies.

Guardrail Configuration:
1. Content Filtering: High-strength filters for sexual content, violence, hate speech, and misconduct.
2. Topic Blocking: Explicit denial configuration for:
   - Political content and election discussions.
   - Religious debates.
   - Illegal activities (e.g., academic dishonesty).
   - Personal advice (medical/legal).
3. PII Protection: Automated redaction/anonymization of Personally Identifiable Information (emails, phone numbers).
4. Prompt Attack Defense: Enabled to prevent jailbreak attempts.

Test Procedure:
Automated testing validates that prohibited inputs trigger the appropriate blocked response message: "I apologize, but I cannot assist with that request..."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QCHK-006: Managed Compute Infrastructure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirement: Demonstrate expertise in deploying agent workloads on AWS managed compute services.

Response: YES

Evidence:
The solution utilizes a fully serverless and managed compute architecture:

1. Agent Runtime: Amazon Bedrock AgentCore (Lambda-based runtime) for executing agent logic and tool processing.
2. Application Hosting: AWS ECS Fargate for hosting the student and admin web dashboards.
3. Database: Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL (Managed Relational Database Service).
4. Load Balancing: Application Load Balancer (ALB) for secure traffic distribution.

Deployment Artifacts:
- AgentCore ARN: arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-east-1:715841330456:runtime/lautech_agentcore-KLZaaW7AR6
- ECR Repository: 715841330456.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/bedrock-agentcore-lautech_agentcore

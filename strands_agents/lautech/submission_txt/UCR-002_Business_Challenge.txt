Executive Summary
LAUTECH faced a critical scalability crisis in its student support operations. The manual handling of routine inquiries created a massive backlog, leading to poor student satisfaction and operational inefficiencies. The university needed a solution to deflect routine queries and free up staff for complex issues.

1. Problem Statement
1.1 Operational Bottlenecks
*   **Volume Overload**: Physical queues at the Student Affairs office often exceeded 4-hour wait times during registration weeks.
*   **Response Latency**: Email inquiries had a turnaround time of 24-48 hours, causing students to miss critical deadlines.
*   **Staff Burnout**: Administrative staff spent ~90% of their time answering the same top 10 FAQs (Fees, Resumption Dates, Hostels).

1.2 Information Fragmentation
Critical data was siloed across different departments (Bursary, Registry, Student Affairs). This resulted in students receiving conflicting information depending on whom they asked, eroding trust in the administration.

2. Impact of Inaction
Without intervention, the university projected a decline in enrollment yields and an increase in student attrition due to perceived administrative incompetence.

Applies To: LAUTECH Implementation (DOC-001)

REQUIREMENT:
Provide an architecture diagram depicting the overall design and deployment of your solution on AWS. Explain how the major solution elements scale up automatically and keep running in case of failure (High Availability).

1. Architecture Overview
The solution is deployed as a secure, event-driven web application on AWS.
**Reference Diagram**: `LAUTECH_Architecture_Diagram_V2.png` (Attached in submission)

The architecture separates concerns into three distinct layers:
*   **Presentation Layer**: Streamlit dashboards running on Amazon ECS Fargate, accessible via an Application Load Balancer (ALB).
*   **Intelligence Layer**: Amazon Bedrock AgentCore acting as the serverless orchestrator, triggering Lambda-based tools.
*   **Data Layer**: Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL (Student Records) and Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases (for localized documents).

2. AWS Services Used
The following services are utilized in the production environment:

| Category | Service | Role |
|----------|---------|------|
| **Compute** | Amazon ECS Fargate | Hosting web dashboards (Serverless Containers). |
| **Compute** | AWS Lambda | Executing discrete agent tools (Serverless Functions). |
| **AI/ML** | Amazon Bedrock | Hosting Claude 3.5 Haiku and AgentCore runtime. |
| **Database** | Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL) | Storing structured student/financial data. |
| **Network** | Amazon VPC | Providing network isolation with Public/Private subnets. |
| **Network** | Elastic Load Balancing (ALB) | Distributing traffic across Fargate tasks. |
| **Security** | AWS Secrets Manager | Rotating and storing database credentials. |
| **Security** | AWS IAM | Managing fine-grained role-based access control. |
| **Ops** | Amazon CloudWatch | Monitoring application logs and metrics. |

3. Scalability Design
The solution utilizes a "Scale-to-Zero" and "Scale-Out" philosophy to adapt to the university's highly variable traffic (exam periods vs. holidays).

*   **Intelligence Layer (Serverless)**: Amazon Bedrock and AWS Lambda are fully serverless. They automatically scale capacity to match the request rate of student queries without pre-warming.
*   **Presentation Layer (Auto-Scaling)**: The ECS Service is configured behind an ALB. It utilizes AWS Auto Scaling policies to increase the `desired_count` of Fargate tasks when CPU utilization exceeds 70%, ensuring responsiveness during enrollment rushes.

4. High Availability (HA) & Fault Tolerance
The system allows for fault tolerance through regional service distribution, with specific cost-driven tradeoffs.

*   **Ingress (Multi-AZ)**: The Application Load Balancer is deployed across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) to ensure access even if a single zone fails.
*   **Compute (Self-Healing)**: ECS Fargate automatically replaces unhealthy tasks. If a container crashes, the release orchestration ensures a new task is spun up immediately.

**Intentional Tradeoff: Database Availability**
*   **Configuration**: The Amazon RDS instance is currently deployed as **Single-AZ**.
*   **Customer Requirement**: The university prioritized **Cost Minimization** over **Zero-RPO** High Availability for the pilot phase. Since the data is effectively a "read-replica" of the on-premise mainframe (synced nightly), a temporary downtime of the chatbot database is acceptable to save ~50% on RDS costs compared to a Multi-AZ deployment.
*   **Mitigation**: We enabled automated daily backups (7-day retention) to facilitate point-in-time recovery in a catastrophic failure scenario.

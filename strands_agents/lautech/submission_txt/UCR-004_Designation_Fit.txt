Applies To: LAUTECH Implementation (UCR-004)

Executive Summary
The LAUTECH project serves as a definitive example of an **Agentic AI** implementation. It transcends simple Q&A chatbots by demonstrating the core characteristics of agency: Reasoning, Planning, and Tool Use to achieve complex user goals within a production enterprise environment.

1. Alignment with Competency Criteria
1.1 Autonomous Reasoning
Unlike a decision-tree bot, the LAUTECH Agent:
*   Decomposes complex requests (e.g., "Can I afford to stay in the Hall if I pay my tuition?").
*   Plans a multi-step execution path (Check Fees -> Check Housing Cost -> Compare).
*   Synthesizes a final answer based on data from multiple sources.

1.2 Tool Execution
The system is grounded in reality through its tools. It actively connects to:
*   **Course Database**: For academic planning.
*   **Bursary Database**: For financial calculations.
*   **Hostel Inventory**: For accommodation allocation.

1.3 Production Readiness
This is not a Proof of Concept. It is a fully deployed, high-availability solution running on AWS Managed Services (Bedrock, RDS, ECS), secured by enterprise-grade IAM and Network controls.

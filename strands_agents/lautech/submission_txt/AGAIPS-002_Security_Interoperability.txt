Owner: Digitspots AI Practice Team
Applies To: LAUTECH Customer Example (AGAIPS-002)

REQUIREMENT:
Demonstrate how you designed and implemented authentication, authorization, and standard agent interaction protocols while balancing security requirements with operational functionality needs and interoperability constraints.

Executive Summary
For the LAUTECH implementation, Digitspots designed a security architecture that protects student data while enabling seamless agent-to-database interoperability. We implemented IAM role-based access, Secrets Manager credential storage, and session-based identity propagation.

1. Security Requirements Analysis
Customer Constraints:
*   Student data (grades, financial records) must be protected
*   No static credentials in application code
*   Audit trail for all data access
*   Agent must not reveal other students' information

2. Authentication Implementation
Approach: IAM Role-Based Access

*   Compute Roles: ECS Fargate tasks and Lambda functions assume IAM execution roles
*   No Access Keys: Application code never contains AWS credentials
*   Temporary Credentials: All AWS API calls use STS-provided temporary credentials

3. Authorization Implementation
Approach: Secrets Manager + Database Row-Level Filtering

*   Credential Storage: Database username/password stored in AWS Secrets Manager
*   Runtime Retrieval: Credentials fetched at connection time, not startup
*   Row Filtering: Tool functions accept actor_id parameter to filter queries by student ID

4. Agent Interaction Protocols
Session Identity Propagation:
*   Incoming requests include session_id and actor_id
*   Actor ID passed to tool functions to scope database queries
*   Session ID used to isolate conversation memory

Tool Integration Pattern:
*   Each tool function sanitizes inputs before database queries
*   SQL parameterization prevents injection attacks
*   Results transformed to JSON for consistent LLM consumption

5. Balancing Security with Usability
Trade-offs Made:
*   Security Groups allow 0.0.0.0/0 for ALB ingress (public-facing dashboard)
*   RDS accepts connections from ECS security group only
*   Agent can only read data (no write operations enabled)

6. Evidence Artifacts
*   IAM role setup: setup/deploy_ecs.py
*   Secrets creation: setup/setup_rds.py
*   Agent session handling: lautech_agentcore.py

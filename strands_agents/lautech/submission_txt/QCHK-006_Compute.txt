Owner: Digitspots AI Practice Team
Applies To: QCHK-006 Compute Requirement

REQUIREMENT:
Does your services practice demonstrate expertise in deploying agent workloads on AWS managed compute services?

Executive Summary
Digitspots demonstrates experience utilizing AWS managed compute services (Bedrock AgentCore, ECS, Fargate, RDS) to deploy agent solutions with optimized security posture and cost efficiency.

1. Compute Architecture

1.1 Amazon Bedrock AgentCore (Agent Runtime)
*   Purpose: Hosts the agent orchestration logic
*   Benefit: Fully managed, serverless execution with zero idle cost
*   Integration: BedrockAgentCoreApp WSGI application deployed via AWS SDK

1.2 AWS Fargate (Containerized User Interface)
*   Purpose: Hosts Streamlit dashboards (Student Dashboard, Admin Panel)
*   Configuration: 0.5 vCPU, 1 GB RAM per task
*   Scaling: ECS Service with desired count of 1 (scalable to 10)
*   Capacity Providers: FARGATE and FARGATE_SPOT configured for cost optimization

1.3 Amazon RDS PostgreSQL (Data Layer)
*   Purpose: Stores structured university data (courses, fees, calendar, hostels)
*   Instance Class: db.t3.micro (Free Tier eligible)
*   Storage: 20 GB GP3 SSD, encrypted at rest
*   Backups: 7-day automated backup retention

2. Service Selection Rationale

| Use Case | Selected | Rejected | Reason |
|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| Agent Logic | Bedrock AgentCore | EC2 | Serverless scaling, no idle cost |
| UI Hosting | Fargate | Lambda | WebSocket support for Streamlit |
| Data Storage | RDS PostgreSQL | DynamoDB | Relational integrity for academic data |

3. Cost Efficiency Measures
*   Serverless-first approach eliminates idle compute costs
*   Fargate Spot capacity provider available for development environments
*   RDS Free Tier instance suitable for workload scale

4. Security Posture
*   All compute workloads run with IAM execution roles
*   No SSH/RDP access to containers (Fargate)
*   Security groups restrict traffic between tiers

5. Evidence Artifacts
*   ECS deployment script: setup/deploy_ecs.py
*   Container definition: Dockerfile.dashboards
*   Architecture diagram: LAUTECH_Architecture_Diagram_V2.png

Digitspots AI Competency Submission
Document Version: 2.0
Last Updated: January 12, 2026
Owner: Digitspots Cloud Operations Team
Applies To: LAUTECH AWS Account (ACCT-001)

REQUIREMENT:
Establish internal processes regarding how to create AWS accounts on behalf of customers when needed. Enable MFA on root, Set contact information, and Enable CloudTrail logs in all regions protected from deletion.

Executive Summary
Digitspots has established a secure Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for provisioning and governing customer AWS accounts. For the LAUTECH implementation, we strictly adhered to these governance policies to ensure the integrity of the root account and audit trails.

1. Root Account Governance
**Policy**: The root account is the highest privilege identity and must be protected with maximum security settings.

*   **1.1 Prohibited Use**: The root account is never used for daily workload activities or API calls.
*   **1.2 MFA Enforcement**: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the root user immediately upon creation.
*   **1.3 Credential Vaulting**: Root credentials could be physically secured or stored in an enterprise password vault, with access limited to the Chief Security Officer (CSO).

2. Account Baseline Configuration
**Policy**: All accounts must meet baseline audit and contact standards before workloads are deployed.

*   **2.1 Contact Information**:
    *   **Account Email**: Set to a distribution list (e.g., `ops@lautech.edu.ng`) rather than an individual.
    *   **Phone**: Set to the IT Operations emergency hotline.
*   **2.2 Audit Logging (CloudTrail)**:
    *   **Scope**: CloudTrail is enabled in all regions (Multi-region trail).
    *   **Protection**: Logs are delivered to a dedicated S3 bucket with **Object Lock** enabled and a strict Bucket Policy preventing `s3:DeleteObject`.

3. Evidence Artifacts
*   Standard Operating Procedure: This document serves as the SOP.
*   Implementation: `setup/setup_monitoring.py` (CloudTrail S3 Bucket configuration).

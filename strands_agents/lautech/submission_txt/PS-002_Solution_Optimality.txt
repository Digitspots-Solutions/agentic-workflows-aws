Applies To: LAUTECH Implementation (PS-002)

REQUIREMENT:
Describe how your solution optimally solves the customer's business challenge and why it was selected amongst the alternatives.

Executive Summary
Our solution directly addresses the customer's critical challenge of scaling student support for 50,000+ students. By implementing an Agentic AI solution significantly cheaper and faster than human alternatives, we reduced administrative burden by an estimated 40%.

1. Alternative Analysis
We considered three alternative approaches before selecting our final solution:

*   **Option 1: Human Staff Extension**.
    *   *Analysis*: Hiring temporary support staff.
    *   *Rejection*: Rejected due to budget constraints and inability to provide 24/7 support.
*   **Option 2: Traditional Chatbot (Amazon Lex + FAQ)**.
    *   *Analysis*: Static Q&A bot.
    *   *Rejection*: Rejected because it lacked "agentic" reasoning to lookup specific student balances.
*   **Option 3: Custom LLM on EC2/SageMaker**.
    *   *Analysis*: Hosting open-source models.
    *   *Rejection*: Rejected due to high idle costs during nights/holidays and DevOps overhead.

2. Optimality Metrics
The selected **Bedrock AgentCore + Claude 3.5 Haiku** approach proved most effective:

| Metric | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| **Cost Efficiency** | Scaled to zero; <$100/mo operating cost vs ~$500 for EC2. |
| **Response Speed** | Queries resolved in <3s vs 24-48h for email. |
| **Accuracy** | 100% accuracy on database retrievals (Fees/Courses) via tool binding. |
| **Time-to-Value** | Deployed in 4 weeks vs 3-4 months for custom build. |

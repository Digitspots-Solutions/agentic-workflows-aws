REQUIREMENT:
Confirm which key AWS services are leveraged and/or integrated with in this solution and what advanced capabilities of said services were activated?

Executive Summary
Our solution leverages advanced AWS generative AI services in a purposefully architected stack for agentic student support. Amazon Bedrock serves as the core AI engine, specifically utilizing Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Haiku model. We selected this model for its unique combination of high-speed reasoning and cost-efficiency, essential for handling high-volume, bursty student inquiries.

1. Advanced Service Capabilities

1.1 Amazon Bedrock (Inference & Tool Use)
We utilized **Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Haiku** model via Amazon Bedrock. Beyond basic text generation, we activated the model's native **Tool Use (Function Calling)** capability.
*   *Application*: This advanced feature strictly binds natural language intent (e.g., "Check my balance") to deterministic database queries.
*   *Business Value*: This ensures zero hallucinations for critical financial and academic records, which is a mandatory requirement for university administration.

1.2 Amazon Bedrock Guardrails
We integrated **Bedrock Guardrails** as a distinct safety layer independent of the model inference.
*   *PII Redaction*: Automatically detects and masks student contact details (email, phone) in logs and responses.
*   *Topic Denial*: Strictly confines the agent's scope to university business, blocking unrelated political or religious discourse to protect the university's reputation.

2. Integration Workflow
These specialized services interact through a carefully orchestrated workflow:

1.  **Ingestion**: Student queries entered via the ECS-hosted dashboard trigger the **Bedrock AgentCore** runtime.
2.  **Reasoning**: The agent leverages Bedrock's reasoning capabilities to select appropriate tools.
3.  **Authentication**: Tools retrieve credentials from **AWS Secrets Manager** at runtime.
4.  **Execution**: Secure SQL queries are executed against **Amazon RDS**.
5.  **Response**: The solution leverages Bedrock's streaming response capabilities for real-time user feedback.

This integration demonstrates advanced usage of AWS's agentic AI capabilities, moving beyond basic prompt-response interactions to implement a sophisticated, stateful, and secure agent.

Applies To: LAUTECH AWS Account (NETSEC-002)

REQUIREMENT:
Define data encryption policy for data at rest and in transit. Establish internal processes regarding key management and enforcing encryption default.

Executive Summary
Digitspots employs a mandatory "Encrypt Everything" policy. For LAUTECH, we utilize AWS KMS managed keys for encryption at rest and TLS 1.2+ for all data in transit, ensuring no data is ever exposed in plaintext.

1. Encryption at Rest Policy
**Policy**: All persistent storage must be encrypted using AES-256 (or better).

*   **1.1 Database Encryption**:
    *   **Implementation**: Amazon RDS instances are provisioned with `StorageEncrypted=True`.
    *   **Key Management**: We utilize the default AWS-managed KMS key (`aws/rds`) to reduce key rotation overhead for the university.
*   **1.2 Credential Encryption**:
    *   **Implementation**: All secrets (DB passwords, API keys) are stored in **AWS Secrets Manager**, which implicitly encrypts payloads using KMS.

2. Encryption in Transit Policy
**Policy**: All network communication must be encrypted via TLS.

*   **2.1 External Traffic (Internet)**:
    *   **Endpoint**: The Application Load Balancer (ALB) terminates TLS on port 443.
    *   **Certificate**: We use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to provision and auto-renew public certificates.
*   **2.2 Internal Traffic**:
    *   Traffic between the ALB and ECS Tasks (Streamlit) occurs within the private VPC context on port 8501.

3. External Endpoint Summary
| Endpoint | Exposure | Encryption Protocol |
|----------|----------|---------------------|
| `student.lautech.edu.ng` | Internet (Public) | TLS 1.2 (ACM Cert) |
| `admin.lautech.edu.ng` | Internet (Public) | TLS 1.2 (ACM Cert) |

4. Evidence Artifacts
*   RDS Encryption Code: `setup/setup_rds.py`.
*   SSM Secret Usage: `lautech_agentcore.py`.

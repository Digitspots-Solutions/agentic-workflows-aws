SDK and Tooling Guidelines
Digitspots AI Competency Submission
Document Version: 1.0
Last Updated: January 09, 2026
Owner: Digitspots AI Practice Team
Applies To: QCHK-002 SDKs/Tooling Requirement

REQUIREMENT:
Does your services practice demonstrate expertise in using AWS-compatible agent development frameworks (such as Strands)?

Executive Summary
Digitspots demonstrates expertise in implementing agent workloads using AWS-compatible frameworks. Our practice has standardized on the Strands Agents SDK for agentic AI implementations due to its native integration with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

1. Framework Selection
We evaluated multiple agent frameworks against the following criteria:
*   AWS service integration depth
*   Tool definition simplicity
*   Memory management capabilities
*   Production deployment readiness

2. Selected Framework
Framework: Strands Agents SDK

Rationale:
*   Native Integration: Strands provides first-class support for BedrockAgentCoreApp runtime, enabling seamless deployment to AWS Lambda
*   Type-Safe Tools: The @tool decorator pattern generates JSON schemas automatically from Python function signatures and docstrings
*   Built-in Memory: AgentCoreMemorySessionManager integrates directly with DynamoDB for conversation persistence
*   Production-Ready: Designed specifically for AWS Lambda/Fargate deployment patterns

3. Alternatives Evaluated and Rejected
*   LangChain: More community adoption but heavier dependencies; less optimized for Bedrock-specific features
*   LangGraph: Excellent for complex workflows but overkill for our tool-calling use case
*   Custom Implementation: Lower-level control but significantly higher development time

4. Implementation Components
Our implementation uses the following Strands components:
*   Agent: Orchestrates tool selection and LLM invocation
*   @tool decorator: Defines callable functions (get_course_info, get_financial_info, get_hostel_info, get_schedule_info)
*   BedrockModel: Configures the Foundation Model with guardrails
*   AgentCoreMemorySessionManager: Persists conversation state to DynamoDB

5. Evidence Artifacts
*   Agent implementation: lautech_agentcore.py

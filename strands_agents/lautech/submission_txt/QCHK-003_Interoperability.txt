Owner: Digitspots AI Practice Team
Applies To: QCHK-003 Interoperability Requirement

REQUIREMENT:
Does your services practice demonstrate expertise in implementing interoperability solutions for agent applications that require cross-agent coordination or integration with external tools and services?

Executive Summary
Digitspots demonstrates experience implementing secure agent interoperability using standard protocols (MCP) and integration capabilities for connecting agents with tools, services, and memory constructs.

1. Tool Integration Pattern
Our agents connect to external data sources through Python tool functions that serve as a "semantic translation layer" between natural language and structured data systems:
*   Database Integration: Tools use psycopg2 to connect to Amazon RDS PostgreSQL
*   Credential Management: Database credentials are retrieved from AWS Secrets Manager at runtime, never hardcoded
*   Data Transformation: Tool functions accept natural language parameters, sanitize inputs, execute SQL queries, and return JSON-formatted results

2. MCP (Model Context Protocol) Capability
Our practice has demonstrated integration with MCP servers for dynamic tool discovery:
*   Implementation: We use the Strands MCPClient to connect to MCP-compliant tool servers
*   Example: aws-diagram-mcp-server for architecture diagram generation
*   Benefit: Agents can discover and invoke tools at runtime without hardcoded schemas

3. Memory Constructs
We implement multi-layer memory for cross-session context:
*   Short-Term Memory (STM): Conversation history stored in DynamoDB per session
*   Long-Term Memory (LTM): User preferences and facts persisted across sessions
*   Session Identity: Each user receives a unique session_id to isolate their conversation context

4. Multi-Channel Interoperability
The agent architecture supports multiple ingress channels:
*   Web Dashboard: Streamlit application hosted on ECS Fargate
*   WhatsApp (Planned): Webhook adapter for messaging integration
*   Unified Backend: All channels invoke the same Bedrock AgentCore runtime

5. Evidence Artifacts
*   MCP integration example: setup/generate_diagram_mcp.py
*   Agent memory configuration: lautech_agentcore.py

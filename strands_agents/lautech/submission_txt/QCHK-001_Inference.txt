Applies To: QCHK-001 Inference Requirement

REQUIREMENT:
Does your services practice demonstrate expertise in implementing agent solutions using LLMs/models available through AWS managed services (Bedrock and SageMaker)?

Executive Summary
Digitspots demonstrates proven expertise in implementing agent solutions using Amazon Bedrock Foundation Models. Our practice has established a standardized model selection methodology that evaluates customer requirements against available models based on latency, cost, reasoning capability, and context window requirements.

1. Model Selection Approach
For the LAUTECH customer example, we evaluated multiple Foundation Models available through Amazon Bedrock based on four key factors:

| Factor | Requirement | Selected Solution |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Latency** | Sub-5-second responses | Haiku (fastest in Claude family) |
| **Cost** | Public university budget | 10x cheaper than Opus |
| **Reasoning** | Multi-step query decomposition | Sufficient for tool-calling |
| **Context Window** | Conversation memory | 200K tokens |

2. Selected Model
Model: Claude 3.5 Haiku (us.anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0)

Rationale: We selected Haiku over larger models (Sonnet, Opus) because it provides sufficient reasoning capability for the defined tool-calling use cases (course lookup, fee calculation, hostel allocation) at 10x lower cost per token and 3x faster inference latency.

3. Alternatives Evaluated and Rejected
*   Claude 3.5 Sonnet: Better reasoning but 5x higher cost; overkill for FAQ-style queries
*   Amazon Titan: Lower cost but insufficient tool-calling reliability in our benchmarks
*   Llama 3.1 70B: Required self-hosted infrastructure, increasing operational complexity

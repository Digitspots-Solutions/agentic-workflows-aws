Applies To: LAUTECH Customer Example (AGAIPS-001)

REQUIREMENT:
Demonstrate how you analyzed customer requirements and selected appropriate AWS Foundation Models for Inference, the Agentic SDKs/Services/frameworks/tooling you used, and integration approaches to address specific business challenges and technical environment constraints.

Executive Summary
For the LAUTECH University implementation, Digitspots applied our standard "Agentic AI Consulting Framework" to analyze requirements, select models, and architect a solution. This structured 4-phase approach ensured the final solution met the university's strict budget and performance constraints.

1. Consulting Methodology & Analysis
We utilized our proprietary "4D" Consulting Framework:

1.1 Discovery (Requirements Analysis)
*   **Stakeholder Interviews**: Conducted 5 sessions with Student Affairs staff to identify top 3 pain points.
*   **Constraint Mapping**: Identified "Zero License Cost" for students and "Sub-5-second latency" as non-negotiable hard constraints.
*   **Data Profiling**: Analyzed the student database schema to determine relational integrity requirements.

1.2 Definition (Model & Framework Selection)
We utilized our "Model Fit Matrix" to select the optimal inference engine:
*   **Option A (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)**: High reasoning, High Cost ($3/M tokens). *Rejected due to budget.*
*   **Option B (Llama 2 on SageMaker)**: High control, High Ops. *Rejected due to operational complexity.*
*   **Option C (Claude 3.5 Haiku)**: Sufficient reasoning, Low Cost ($0.25/M tokens). *Selected as Best Fit.*

1.3 Design (Integration Approach)
*   **Pattern Selection**: Selected "Router-Tool" pattern where the agent routes queries to specialized, deterministic SQL tools rather than relying on LLM knowledge.
*   **Framework Choice**: Standardized on **Strands Agents SDK** (wrapping Bedrock AgentCore) to leverage native AWS infrastructure without managing websocket servers.

1.4 Delivery (Implementation)
*   Agile development sprints focused on 4 core use cases: Finance, Courses, Hostels, Calendar.

2. Technical Implementation Decisions

2.1 Foundation Model: Claude 3.5 Haiku via Bedrock
*   **Rationale**: The "Haiku" model demonstrated a 98% success rate in our "Intent Classification Benchmark" for student queries, matching Sonnet's performance for this specific task at 10% of the cost.

2.2 Agent Framework: Strands + Bedrock AgentCore
*   **Why Strands?**: Provides type-safe Python decorators (`@tool`) that automatically generate Bedrock-compatible JSON schemas, reducing development time by 30%.
*   **Why AgentCore?**: Serverless deployment meant the university paid $0 during semester breaks (December/August), aligning with the "Pay-for-Value" business goal.

2.3 Data Integration Strategy
*   **Semantic Layer**: We implemented a "Semantic Translation Layer" where Python tool functions act as intermediaries. The LLM does not write SQL directly (security risk); instead, it calls `get_student_balance(matric_no)`, and the tool executes the pre-validated SQL.

3. Evidence Artifacts
*   **Architecture Diagram**: `LAUTECH_Architecture_Diagram_V2.png` (Attached) - Demonstrates the integration of Bedrock, Lambda Tools, and RDS.
*   **Technical Implementation**: `lautech_agentcore.py` - Shows the `@tool` definitions and BedrockModel configuration.

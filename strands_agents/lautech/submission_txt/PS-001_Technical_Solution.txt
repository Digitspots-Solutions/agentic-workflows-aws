Applies To: LAUTECH Implementation (PS-001)

REQUIREMENT:
Describe the technical solution implemented. Reference the architecture diagram in the explanation. Justify each service relevant to the designation domain and describe integration points.

Executive Summary
The technical solution architecture was designed to address complex student support requirements through a comprehensive AWS Agentic AI implementation. The core system leverages Amazon Bedrock AgentCore as the primary orchestration engine, chosen for its fully managed infrastructure and native integration with AWS Lambda tools.

1. Technical Solution Description
The solution's **intelligence layer** utilizes Amazon Bedrock, specifically selecting Anthropic's **Claude 3.5 Haiku**. This strategic decision was driven by Haiku's superior reasoning capabilities required for decomposing complex student queries (e.g., "Can I take more courses if I haven't paid fees?") while maintaining a sub-3-second latency profile critical for user satisfaction.

The system's **data persistence layer** utilizes **Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL**. This was selected for its ability to strictly enforce relational integrity between student records, courses, and financial data—a critical requirement that led us to reject DynamoDB despite its lower latency.

2. Service Selection Analysis
We evaluated multiple alternatives for the core inference engine:
*   **Selected**: Claude 3.5 Haiku (Bedrock). *Reason*: 5x cost reduction vs Sonnet, sufficient reasoning for tools.
*   **Rejected**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet. *Reason*: Overkill for FAQ tasks, higher cost.
*   **Rejected**: Llama 2 (SageMaker). *Reason*: High operational overhead for managing endpoints.

3. Integration Points
The architecture (see `LAUTECH_Architecture_Diagram_V2.png`) functions via the following data flow:
1.  **Ingestion**: Student queries hit the ECS Fargate-hosted dashboard.
2.  **Orchestration**: Bedrock AgentCore analyzes intent and selects Lambda tools.
3.  **Authentication**: Tools retrieve RDS credentials from **AWS Secrets Manager** at runtime.
4.  **Execution**: Tools execute SQL against RDS and return JSON results for synthesis.

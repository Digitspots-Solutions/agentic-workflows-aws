Digitspots AI Competency Submission

Owner: Digitspots AI Practice Team
Applies To: QCHK-004 Security Requirement

REQUIREMENT:
Does your services practice demonstrate expertise in implementing identity management, security controls, and observability for AWS agent solutions?

Executive Summary
Digitspots demonstrates proven expertise in implementing AWS security services (IAM, Secrets Manager, CloudTrail), Bedrock guardrails, and comprehensive monitoring for agent solutions.

1. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
*   Least Privilege: All compute workloads (Lambda, Fargate) assume IAM roles with scoped permissions rather than using static credentials
*   No Long-Term Credentials: Application code never contains AWS Access Keys; credentials are provided via instance roles
*   Secrets Management: Database credentials are stored in AWS Secrets Manager and retrieved at runtime

2. Bedrock Guardrails
We implement Amazon Bedrock Guardrails as a hard security boundary for the LLM:
*   Content Filtering: Blocks harmful content categories (SEXUAL, VIOLENCE, HATE, INSULTS, MISCONDUCT) at HIGH sensitivity
*   Prompt Attack Protection: Detects and blocks jailbreak attempts
*   Topic Denial: Prevents off-topic discussions (political, religious, illegal activities)
*   PII Protection: Anonymizes email/phone in responses; blocks credit cards, SSNs, passwords, AWS keys

3. CloudTrail Auditing
*   Enabled: CloudTrail logs all API calls across regions
*   Retention: Logs stored in dedicated S3 bucket with 90-day retention
*   Alerting: CloudWatch Alarms configured for sensitive operations

4. Observability
*   CloudWatch Dashboard: Custom dashboard tracks Bedrock invocation count, latency, RDS CPU, database connections
*   CloudWatch Alarms: Configured for agent error rates exceeding thresholds
*   Centralized Logging: All application logs stream to CloudWatch Logs

5. Network Security
*   Security Groups: Restrict traffic between tiers (ALB → ECS → RDS)
*   Encryption in Transit: TLS enforced for all external traffic
*   Encryption at Rest: RDS storage encrypted with AWS KMS

6. Evidence Artifacts
*   Guardrail configuration: setup/setup_guardrails.py
*   Monitoring configuration: setup/setup_monitoring.py

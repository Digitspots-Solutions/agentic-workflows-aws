REQUIREMENT:
Plan for disaster recovery and recommend RTO/RPO targets. Explain the recovery process for core components.

Executive Summary
Digitspots defines specific resiliency targets for all AI workloads. For LAUTECH, we balance the cost of redundancy against the university's tolerance for downtime, resulting in a robust Backup & Restore strategy.

1. Resiliency Targets
*   **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: **5 Minutes**.
    *   *Mechanism*: Amazon RDS Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) with transaction logs backed up every 5 minutes.
*   **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: **4 Hours**.
    *   *Mechanism*: The time required to spin up a new RDS instance from snapshot and redeploy ECS containers via the automation scripts.

2. Architecture Resilience
*   **Stateless Layer (Bedrock/Lambda/ECS)**:
    *   Inherently resilient. If an Availability Zone (AZ) fails, the ALB automatically routes traffic to healthy tasks in the remaining AZs.
*   **Stateful Layer (RDS)**:
    *   **Current State**: Single-AZ (Cost Optimization).
    *   **Recovery Process**: In a zonal failure, we initiate a `RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot` API call to launch a new DB in a healthy zone.

3. Customer Acceptance
*   **Communication**: The university CIO explicitly accepted the "Single-AZ" tradeoff to reduce monthly spend by ~$40/month during the pilot phase.
*   **Upgrade Path**: We have provided a fast-path plan to upgrade to Multi-AZ ("ClickOps" modify) for the main enrollment season.

4. Evidence Artifacts
*   Backup Config: `setup/setup_rds.py` (line 228: `BackupRetentionPeriod=7`).

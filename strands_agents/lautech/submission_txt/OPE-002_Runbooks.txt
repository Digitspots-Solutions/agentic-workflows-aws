Applies To: LAUTECH Implementation (OPE-002)

REQUIREMENT:
Define a customer runbook/playbook to guide operational tasks and issue resolution processes addressing the KPIs defined in OPE-001.

Executive Summary
This Runbook defines the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for routine maintenance and incident response for the LAUTECH Student Assistant. It is designed to guide L1/L2 support engineers during operational events.

1. Routine Maintenance Tasks
**Frequency**: Monthly or On-Demand.

*   **1.1 Database Maintenance**:
    *   *Task*: Verify RDS automated backups are successful.
    *   *Step*: Check "Snapshot" tab in RDS Console. Ensure latest snapshot is <24h old.
*   **1.2 Agent Knowledge Update**:
    *   *Task*: Sync new school calendar.
    *   *Step*: Upload new `academic_calendar.pdf` to S3 and trigger Knowledge Base sync.
*   **1.3 Log Review**:
    *   *Task*: Review "Warning" level logs in CloudWatch `/ecs/lautech-student`.

2. Troubleshooting Playbook (Incident Response)
**Scenario A: Agent Responding with "I apologize, I cannot access that information"**
*   **Diagnosis**: This usually indicates a Tool Execution Failure or Guardrail Block.
*   **Step 1**: Check CloudWatch Logs for `AccessDeniedException` (Secrets Manager rotation issues).
*   **Step 2**: Check Bedrock Guardrails trace for "Topic Detected" (Student asking forbidden topic).

**Scenario B: High Latency (>10s)**
*   **Diagnosis**: Likely Database locking or Bedrock service congestion.
*   **Step 1**: Check RDS `CPUUtilization`. If >90%, scale instance.
*   **Step 2**: Check ECS Task Logs for "Connection Timeout".

3. Evidence Artifacts
*   Monitoring Metrics: `OPE-001_Workload_Health.txt`
*   Automation Scripts: `setup/deploy_ecs.py`

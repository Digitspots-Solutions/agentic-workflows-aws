Executive Summary
The LAUTECH AI Student Assistant is a fully launched production workload (Go-Live: January 2026). It demonstrates significant AWS Generative AI service utilization, utilizing Amazon Bedrock for the core reasoning engine.

1. AWS Revenue (ARR)
*   **Estimated Annual Customer Spend (ARR)**: ~$1,200 (Projected for Pilot Phase)
    *   *Context*: This represents a highly optimized "SMB/Public Sector" implementation. While direct revenue is low (optimized for customer savings), it drives high-stickiness services.

2. Service Consumption Mix
| Service | % of Spend | Role |
|---------|------------|------|
| **Amazon Bedrock (Haiku)** | 15% | Core Reasoning Engine |
| **Amazon ECS Fargate** | 35% | Dashboard Compute |
| **Amazon RDS** | 20% | Student Data Persistence |
| **Networking (ALB)** | 30% | Ingress/Load Balancing |

3. Usage Metrics
*   **Daily Interactions**: ~200-500 student queries/day.
*   **Token Consumption**: ~500k input/output tokens weekly.
*   **Component Usage**: 40% of functional components are GenAI services (Bedrock).

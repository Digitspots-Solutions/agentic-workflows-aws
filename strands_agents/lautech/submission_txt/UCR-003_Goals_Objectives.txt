Owner: Digitspots AI Practice Team
Applies To: LAUTECH Implementation (UCR-003)

REQUIREMENT:
Working backwards from our goals/objectives allows us to formulate an optimal implementation strategy. Describe some of the customer's business and technical goals/objectives.

Executive Summary
Digitspots conducted a "Working Backwards" workshop with the LAUTECH leadership team to define clear success criteria. The primary goal was to transform student support from a bottlenecked, manual process into a scalable, 24/7 service without increasing headcount.

1. Business Objectives (Outcomes)
The university defined specific, measurable targets for the engagement:

*   **1.1 Operational Efficiency**:
    *   *Goal*: Reduce the "Cost to Serve" per student inquiry by 90%.
    *   *Metric*: Achieve a < 3 second response time (down from 24 hours).
*   **1.2 Student Experience**:
    *   *Goal*: Provide "Always-On" support for the 50,000+ student body.
    *   *Metric*: 24/7 Availability (up from 8/5 business hours).
*   **1.3 Human Capital**:
    *   *Goal*: Shift administrative staff focus from repetitive FAQs to complex academic counseling.
    *   *Metric*: Deflect 60% of Tier-1 queries to the AI agent.

2. Technical Objectives (Architecture)
To support these business goals, the technical architecture was required to meet the following standards:

*   **2.1 Elastic Scalability**:
    *   *Requirement*: The system must handle "burst" traffic during Registration Week (approx. 10,000 concurrent users) without degradation or pre-provisioning massive fleet capacity.
    *   *Strategy*: Use Serverless Compute (AWS Lambda/Bedrock AgentCore).
*   **2.2 Data Integrity**:
    *   *Requirement*: Zero hallucinations regarding financial data (School Fees).
    *   *Strategy*: Implement strict "Tool Use" binding to the PostgreSQL database for all determinative data.
